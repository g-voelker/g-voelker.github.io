	<p>Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are important distributors of energy and momentum in a stratified atmosphere. While they are mostly excited at lower altitudes their effects are most important between the upper troposphere to the mesopause (∼85km). While propagating—both in the vertical and the horizontal—nonlinear IGWs can exert a wave drag on the large-scale winds, interact with the large-scale potential temperature, and influence transport and mixing of atmospheric constituents such as aerosols or greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p>As gravity waves cover a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (~10⁻¹–10⁵km) they are largely unresolved in models of medium to low resolution (c.f. Fig. 1). They may thus be parameterized to capture their effect.</p>
