    <p>We implement MS-GWaM into the high top model UA-ICON. All runs use the R2B4 grid specififcation (160km resolution) with 120 
    vertical layers for a model top at 150km. Bölöni et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2021) showed that the columnar, i.e. one 
    dimensional implementation of MS-GWaM produces reasonable structures in the simulated winds and temperatures. Here we drop the
    assumption of a strictly columnar propagation and instead introduce the fully three dimensional implementation of MS-GWaM.
    As before the wave model contains various non-orographic wave sources, non-dissipative wave-mean-flow interactions as well as
    wave breaking. An eﬃcient parallelization of the Lagrangian ray-tracing scheme allows for simulations with transient wave
    eﬀects in reasonable computation times.</p>

    <p>Comparing simulation result composites for June for ICON with MS-GWaM in one and three dimensions with the URAP climatology one 
    may find that the the parametrization generally performs as expected with comparable zonal-mean zonal winds (Fig. 9). Note that 
    the three dimensional setup has not been tuned to ensure comparability with the one dimensional implementation.</p>

            Fig. 10: Global horizontal average of the global wave action tendencies. Here we show the wave action change due to 
            wave dissipation (panel a; red), wave sources (panel a; blue), the horizontal, vertical and total wave propagation
            (panel b; violet, blue  and red) as well as the total wave action tendency (panel c; black). Solid ald dashed lines
            refer to the three and one dimensional implementation, respectively.

    <p>Comparing the global horizontal average of the tendency of the phase space integrated wave action field from shorter 
    simulations we find that the three dimensional propagation does not significantly change the global wave energy balance
    (Fig. 10). THe horizontal distribution of wave action, momentum fluxes and winds does, however, differ significantly.</p>

        - refer to one dimensional papers
        - novel: 3 dimensions
        - zonal mean zonal wind → good overall performance
        - horizontally averaged wave action tendency → similarity between 1D and 3D
        - denote that the differences lie in the horizontal distribution and the local forcing
