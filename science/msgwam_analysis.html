        <p>Albeit the global horizontal average of the dynamics is not significantly influenced by the three dimensional gravity
        wave propagaton (Fig. 10) there are important differences in the spatial structure of the wave action, wind structures and
        temperature. In the one dimensional case the vertical propagation balances with the wave dissipation with a relatively 
        homogeneous distribution in the extratropics where a homogeneous background source is active (Figs. 4 and 5, see slider).
        What is more, the wave action tendency is sparse near convective wave sources as the waves do not propagate horizontally.
        In contrast the three dimensional case exhibits a balance between both the horizontal and the vertical propagation as well 
        as the wave dissipation (Figs. 6 - 8, see slider). Convectively generated waves are more distributed and background sources
        more confined due to the wind structures and three dimensional wave refraction.</p>

                Fig. 11: Polar map of the meridional momentum flux around the Southpole at \(z\approx 40km\) for the one dimensioal
                (left) and the three dimensional implementation (right) of MS-GWaM averaged over the simulated month June 1991.
                The contour lines show the corresponding zonal wind.

        <p>A more detailed view on the south polar region, averaged over in June 1991, reveals important interactions between waves 
        and the polar jet stream. In particular one finds that the meridional gravity wave momentum flux shows the typical 
        convergence into the jet stream as often observed (Fig. 11). Also, the structure of the zonal wind of the jet stream 
        shifts from a rather symmetric structure to an open shape when considering three dimensonally propagating gravity waves.</p>
        <p>Summarizing we present a gravity wave parametrization that does not rely on neither the single column approximation nor
        the steady state paradigm. Therein the internal gravity waves are modeled as Lagrangian ray volumes which transiently
        propagate through the atmosphere and interact with the mean flow through non-dissipative interaction and wave breaking. The 
        parametrization yields often observed structures in the dynamics that state-of-the-art parametrizations can not reproduce. 
        Finally, MS-GWaM offers the possibility to analyze the three dimensional behavior of internal gravity waves in the 
        atmosphere on a global scale.</p>
