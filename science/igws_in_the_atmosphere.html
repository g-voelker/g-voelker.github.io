	<p>Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are important distributors of energy and momentum in a stratified atmosphere. While they are mostly excited at lower altitudes their effects are most important between the upper troposphere to the mesopause (∼85km). While propagating—both in the vertical and the horizontal—nonlinear IGWs can exert a wave drag on the large-scale winds, interact with the large-scale potential temperature, and influence transport and mixing of atmospheric constituents such as aerosols or greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p>As gravity waves cover a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (~10⁻¹–10⁵km) they are largely unresolved in models of medium to low resolution (c.f. Fig. 1). They may thus be parameterized to capture their effect.</p>

	<p>In state-of-the art weather prediction models subgrid-scale IGWs are typically parameterized neglecting both the horizontal wave propagation (single-column assumption) and the transient wave behavior including wave-mean-flow interactions and time dependent wave generation (steady-state assumption). The potential importance of the horizontal wave propagation and wave transience has, however, been shown in various theoretical, numerical and experimental studies.</p>
