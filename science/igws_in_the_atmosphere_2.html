	<p>In state-of-the art weather prediction models subgrid-scale IGWs are typically parameterized neglecting both the horizontal wave propagation (single-column assumption) and the transient wave behavior including wave-mean-flow interactions and time dependent wave generation (steady-state assumption). The potential importance of the horizontal wave propagation and wave transience has, however, been shown in various theoretical, numerical and experimental studies.</p>
